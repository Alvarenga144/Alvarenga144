# Hi! Welcome to Alvarenga144's repositories ðŸ«¡
I'm a Web Developer specialized in Frontend, but I also have knowledge of the backend. I started to programming on 2020 (yeah, the year of pandemic). I was studied Technician of Engineering in Informatics Systems, and I graduated in 2023. I'm a Salvadorean, currently searching work as Frontend Developer with Reac.js, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I have general skills in design patterns, and I apply that in UI web interfaces.
